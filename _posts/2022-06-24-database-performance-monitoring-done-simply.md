In the recent years we have been told about how important is to keep our databases in check. From 
having good indices (huge shoutout to [Use The Index, Luke](https://use-the-index-luke.com/)){:target="_blank"}, using the proper relationships and even leveraging an APM solution to track the 90th slowest queries.

These techniques are **very important** and play different roles when it comes to keeping the database
responsive.
