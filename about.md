title: About me
---

I've been working as a Software Engineer for nearly **13 years** now and have had the opportunity
to work with amazing people and very exciting projects. Developing solutions from the [Olympics](posts/como-um-bot-telegram-salvou-as-olimpiadas)
to the [biggest ride hailing app solution in the Eastern Africa region](https://safeboda.com){:target="\_blank"}

Right now I am working at [Dott](https://ridedott.com/), Europe's leading solution for urban micromobility present in Europe and Middle East. I'm part of the Ride Experience team that develops the customer facing application and its services. It's very exciting to ship stuff that impacts people directly!

During this journey I collaborated with over **30 nationalities!** üåê

As far as technology goes, I've been developing using **NodeJS, Elixir, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Docker,
Kubernetes** and some more in the recent years.

I enjoy functional programming and try to keep an eye in the Developer Experience and code simplicity.

I am a huge advocate of **Feature Flags** as a mitigation/roll-out mechanism!
