title: About me
---

I've been working as a Software Engineer for nearly **12 years** now and have had the opportunity
to work with amazing people and very exciting projects. Developing solutions from the [Olympics](posts/como-um-bot-telegram-salvou-as-olimpiadas)
to the [biggest ride hailing app solution in the Eastern Africa region](https://safeboda.com){:target="\_blank"}

Right now I am working at [TIER](https://tier.app), Europe's leading solution for urban micromobility present in Europe and Middle East. I'm part of the IoT team developing the backend services that integrates with the vehicle's hardware.

During this journey I collaborated with over **20 nationalities!** üåê

As far as technology goes, I've been developing using **NodeJS, Elixir, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Docker,
Kubernetes** and some more in the recent years.

I enjoy functional programming and try to keep an eye in the Developer Experience and code simplicity.

I am a huge advocate of **Feature Flags** as a mitigation/roll-out mechanism!
