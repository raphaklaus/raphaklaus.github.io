title: About me
---

I've been working as a Software Engineer for nearly **12 years** now and have had the opportunity
to work with amazing people and very exciting projects. Developing solutions from the [Olympics](posts/como-um-bot-telegram-salvou-as-olimpiadas)
to the [biggest mobility/delivery solution in the East African region](https://safeboda.com){:target="_blank"}

Right now I am working at [Gartner](https://gartner.com){:target="_blank"} helping to develop [their Software Comparison solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capterra){:target="_blank"} that has operations in Europe, Americas and now in Japan.

During this journey I collaborated with over **20 nationalities!** üåê

As far as technology goes, I've been developing using **Elixir, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Docker,
Kubernetes** and some more in the recent years.

I enjoy functional programming and try to keep an eye in the Developer Experience and code simplicity.

I am a huge advocate of **Feature Flags** as a mitigation/roll-out mechanism!
