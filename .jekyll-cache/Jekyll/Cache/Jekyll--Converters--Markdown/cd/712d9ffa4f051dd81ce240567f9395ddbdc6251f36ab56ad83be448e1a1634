I"ê<p>Currently Iâ€™m focused on building backend applications.</p>

<p>My main languages are: <strong>TypeScript (NodeJS) and Elixir</strong>, but I have experience with many others like Ruby, C# and PHP.</p>

<p>I have worked many times with <strong>PostgreSQL, Redis and different frontend libraries/frameworks</strong> despite I am not following the latest trends since I decided to focus on the backend side, I still understand much of the important
frontend concerns to make great software.</p>

<p>Lately Iâ€™ve been working with RabbitMQ, Kafka, distributed systems, AWS and have learned quite a lot!</p>

<p>My focus is to build software with quality, trying as much as possible to do it with tests <strong>(TDD FTW!)</strong>, following the best standards/guidelines in order to deliver an amazing experience to the user.</p>

<p>From time to time I write things unrelated to my main area of work. These include <strong>shaders, emulators and games</strong>! Check the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> section to learn more.</p>
