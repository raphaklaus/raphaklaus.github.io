I"ð<p>Currently, Iâ€™m focused on building backend applications.</p>

<p>My main languages are: TypeScript (NodeJS) and Elixir, but I have experience with many others like Ruby, C# and PHP.</p>

<p>I have worked many times with PostgreSQL, Redis and different frontend libraries/frameworks despite I am not following the latest trends since I decided to focus on the backend side, I still understand much of the important
frontend concerns to make great software.</p>

<p>Lately Iâ€™ve been working with RabbitMQ, Kafka, distributed systems and AWS and have learned quite a lot!</p>

<p>My focus is to build software with quality, trying as much as possible to do it with tests (TDD FTW!), following the best standards/guidelines in order to deliver an amazing experience to the user.</p>
